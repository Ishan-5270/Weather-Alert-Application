# Weather-Alert-Application
This weather alert application uses Open Weather Map's API to retrive the weather conditions & Twilio's API to send messages 
The application runs daily using the Python Anywhere service. The current location is set to Madison, WI (where I am based) and runs every morning at 7 am to send helpful weather updates such as bring an umbrealla if its raining, or taking a walk if it is sunny!
